**Something silly I made. I know nobody will use this except me.**

**To be added in future:**

*- Automatic partitioning*

## To use:

[!] Pre-partitioning is required.

- Copy all files to /tmp
- Populate 'install-config.env' with your desired values. *(See section below!)*
- Mark 'installstage1.sh' and 'installstage2.sh' as executable if they aren't already.
- Simply run installstage1.sh and there you go.

## install-config.env

*Values:*
username = Your desired username 
password = Your desired password
hostname = Your desired hostname
rootpart = Your root partition (e.g insert 'sda2' if your root partition is /dev/sda2)
bootefipart = Either your boot partition, or EFI System Partition. (e.g 'sda1' if your boot or EFI partition is /dev/sda1)
disk = Disk name. (e.g 'sda' if your disk is /dev/sda)
